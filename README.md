# NuggetLovesYou
## A good website for an even greater dog.
whydaniel, december 2021 - january 2022.

### About this Website
This website was created during the summer of 2020 as a dedication to Nugget, Duke's residential dog. Nugget cured my fear of dogs. Nugget is a gift from doG backwards. Nugget is among my top 3 reasons I still go to Duke, and I've lived in the same dorm as Zion. Even though many of us could not be there on-campus, this website was created to remind people of Nugget's joyous energy and to bring a little bit of happiness into people's lives amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the initial launch failed due to a unappealing mobile view and lack of Nugget photos. Which leads into version 2. 

With the suggestions of Yasa Baig ([@yasab27](https://github.com/yasab27)), this website is being recoded over winter break using a different React frontend.

Version 1 (HTML/CSS/Bootstrap Frontend + Node.js/Express/MongoDB Backend) can be found on the versionOne branch of this repo.

### TODO List
- Only other files you should have to change is App.cs, App.js, assets, assets.json
- Replace favicon.io, logo192.png, logo512.png, and manifest.json to change the header.

### Dev Log
- December 2021: Decided to revamp this thing again!
- Made this README.md page and backend progress

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
